        In this game, the player moves a PADDLE side-to-side using the left
        and the right arrows to hit the BALL. The gameâ€™s objective is to eliminate
        all of the BRICKS at the top of the screen by hitting them with the
        BALL. But, if the ball hits the bottom ENCLOSURE more than 5 times, the player loses and
        the game ends! To win the game, all the BRICKS must be eliminated.
